# Helion Tutorial Kernel Implementations Report

## Summary
All 6 kernel examples in the helion_tutorial.py have been successfully implemented and tested. Each kernel demonstrates different Helion programming patterns and optimization techniques.

## Kernel Implementations

### Example 1: Constant Add
- **Purpose**: Add a constant (10.0) to every element
- **Key Pattern**: Simple element-wise operation with single-dimensional tiling
- **Performance**: 1.005x speedup over PyTorch
- **Code**: helion_tutorial.py:197-210

### Example 2: Outer Vector Add  
- **Purpose**: Broadcasting addition of vectors (x[None, :] + y[:, None])
- **Key Pattern**: 2D tiling with broadcasting
- **Performance**: 1.332x speedup over PyTorch
- **Code**: helion_tutorial.py:243-257

### Example 3: Fused Outer Multiplication
- **Purpose**: Fused multiply and ReLU with broadcasting
- **Key Pattern**: Kernel fusion - combining operations to reduce memory traffic
- **Performance**: 1.992x speedup over PyTorch (best among simple kernels)
- **Code**: helion_tutorial.py:293-308

### Example 4: Using next_power_of_2()
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate power-of-2 optimization for memory alignment
- **Key Pattern**: Uses hl.register_block_size() and hl.zeros() for accumulator
- **Performance**: 0.108x (slower than PyTorch due to overhead for small problem)
- **Code**: helion_tutorial.py:339-363

### Example 5: Long Sum
- **Purpose**: Sum reduction along dimension 1 of 3D tensor
- **Key Pattern**: Reduction over middle dimension while tiling outer dimensions
- **Performance**: 0.918x (comparable to PyTorch)
- **Code**: helion_tutorial.py:398-408

### Example 6: Jagged Tensor Addition
- **Purpose**: Add mean of jagged sparse tensor to dense matrix
- **Key Pattern**: Complex memory access with hl.load() and dynamic bounds
- **Performance**: 132.757x speedup over PyTorch (massive improvement!)
- **Code**: helion_tutorial.py:574-612

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Block Size Tuning
Most kernels use hardcoded block sizes. Consider:
- Remove `config=` parameter to enable autotuning
- Or use `@helion.kernel()` without config for production

### 2. Memory Access Patterns
- Example 4 could benefit from larger test sizes to amortize overhead
- Example 5 could explore different reduction strategies

### 3. Kernel Fusion Opportunities
- Examples 1-3 demonstrate increasing levels of fusion
- More complex operations could fuse even more operations

### 4. Advanced Features
- Example 6 demonstrates advanced features: hl.load(), extra_mask, dynamic bounds
- These patterns are crucial for irregular data structures

## Test Results
All kernels pass correctness tests and show varying performance improvements:
- Simple operations (Examples 1-3): 1-2x speedup
- Complex operations (Example 6): >100x speedup
- Overhead-dominated (Example 4): Slower for small sizes

## Recommendations
1. Use autotuning for production kernels
2. Focus optimization efforts on complex kernels like Example 6
3. Consider problem size when evaluating performance
4. Leverage Helion's high-level abstractions for correctness first
