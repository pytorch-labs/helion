Helion is new Python-embedded DSL for machine learning kernels that gets lowered to [Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton).  The main goal of Helion is to be a higher level language that makes it easier to write kernels and automate more of the autotuning process.  The name Helion is is a reference to the helium-3 nucleus (while Triton is a reference to hydrogen-3).

*Warning:* Helion is still an early development prototype.  You should expect to find bugs (please report them!) and rough edges.  APIs are subject to change, and we are not yet guaranteeing backward compatibility.
